## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```
Users (id, username, email, skills, location, timezone, role, experience, team_id)
Teams (id, name, description, owner_id, status, max_members)
Skills (id, name, category)
UserSkills (user_id, skill_id, proficiency)
Interests (id, name)

TeamApplications (team_id, user_id, status, message)
```

### API Structure
- Authentication endpoints (register, login)
- Profile management endpoints
- Team CRUD operations
- Team discovery and application endpoints

### Matching Algorithm
The core of our application is the weighted matching algorithm that calculates compatibility scores based on:
- Skill overlap and complementarity (40%)
- Interest alignment (30%)
- Role needs fulfillment (20%)
- Timezone/location compatibility (10%)

## üíª Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (or Python/Flask)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Heroku (backend)
